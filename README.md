# GitHub Profile Search App

> ⚠️ **Note:** The project idea and UI/UX design are **not my own**. This project is based on a challenge from [DevChallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io/challenge/github-profile). I picked this challenge to practice frontend development and learn API integration.

## Project Overview

This is a **GitHub Profile Search application** that allows users to search for GitHub profiles and display relevant information. The app utilizes multiple API endpoints, primarily the **GitHub REST API**, which returns data about users, repositories, and other related information in JSON format.

The project focuses on:
- Fetching and displaying GitHub user profiles dynamically through REST APIs.
- Practicing **frontend development skills** including responsive design and UI enhancements.

## Features
